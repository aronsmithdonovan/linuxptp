A hacker is a person skilled in information technology who uses their technical knowledge to achieve a goal or overcome an obstacle, within a computerized system by non-standard means. Though the term hacker has become associated in popular culture with a security hacker - someone who utilizes their technical know-how of bugs or exploits to break into computer systems and access data which would otherwise be unavailable to them - hacking can also be utilized by legitimate figures in legal situations. Today, mainstream usage of "hacker" mostly refers to computer criminals, due to the mass media usage of the word since the 1990s. This includes what hacker slang calls "script kiddies", people breaking into computers using programs written by others, with very little knowledge about the way they work. This usage has become so predominant that the general public is largely unaware that different meanings exist. While the self-designation of hobbyists as hackers is generally acknowledged and accepted by computer security hackers, people from the programming subculture consider the computer intrusion-related usage incorrect, and emphasize the difference between the two by calling security breakers "crackers" (analogous to a safecracker).
