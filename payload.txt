A hacker is a person skilled in information technology who uses their technical knowledge to achieve a goal or overcome an obstacle, within a computerized system by non-standard means. Though the term hacker has become associated in popular culture with a security hacker - someone who utilizes their technical know-how of bugs or exploits to break into computer systems and access data which would otherwise be unavailable to them - hacking can also be utilized by legitimate figures in legal situations.
